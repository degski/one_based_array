# one_based_array

Useful for certain algorithms. This array provides compile time one-based-indexing and is similar to std::array. Both member functions `const_pointer data ( )` (alias `const_pointer b0data ( )`)  are compile-time constants. Inter-operability with the STL and with `std::array` in particular are provided.
